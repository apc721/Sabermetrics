# Sabermetrics
Hello, I created this project as a tool to analyze my personal and team hitting statistics in specific counts. 

## Results 
Through this, I discovered that I am very hesitant to swing at pitches early in the count, especially the first pitch. However, when I did, results were on
average better. I often dug myself into a lot of 2 strike counts which typically have the worst outcomes. While that came with a handful of walks, it also led to
some avoidable strikeouts.

## Feedback
Any feedback (positive and negative) is appreciated and feel free share any implementation ideas... there are a lot of places to go with this.
